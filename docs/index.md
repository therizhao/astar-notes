# Astar Notes <small>βeta</small>

## Beautiful A levels notes for all subjects 🌈

Astar Notes contains the most awesome A levels notes compiled over generations of A levels students.

## How is this different from the gazillions of notes websites out there? 🤔

### 👐 Astar Notes is open-source

- Anyone can contribute, edit & delete the notes
- Ensures that only the best notes survive
- Think of it as a Wikipedia for A levels. I believe that only with continuous crowd-contribution can the quality of notes be top-notch.

### 🚀 Astar Notes is free forever

- I built this to fulfil my teenage dream of having a proper notes website for A levels students
- Dreams don't need to be powered by money 🦄

### 👶 Astar Notes is built by a kid

- This is not really an advantage. But oh well, I am trying to make up 3 points 😅

## Contributing

- [Join our Google Docs to contribute to the notes][1]

### Process

1. Copy paste your notes into the Google Docs
2. I will copy paste the latest changes into this website.

### Note

- Things are somewhat low-tech currently, but if I see enough traction, I will build a custom editor to make my life easier 😎
- The number of subjects are kinda limited right now (Sorry for the false advertisement 😜). [Please feel free to add more subjects into the Google Docs.][1]

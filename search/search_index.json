I'm sorry, but if you find the poor English too much of an eyesore, please edit it here \ud83d\udc48 Why is the content wrong? I'm sorry, but if you think that we are spreading misinformation, please edit it here \ud83d\udc48 Why aren't there more questions in this FAQ?

Aerobic Respiration Glycolysis Definition Glycolysis is the sequence of reactions that breaks down glucose to pyruvate with simultaneous trapping of energy released as ATP , accompanied by the formation of NADH/H+ .

Process Source of protons (H + ) Reduction of NAD+ to NADH/H+ in glycolysis, link reaction and Krebs cycle. Reduction of FADH2 in Krebs cycle. Details High energy electrons from NADH/H + and FADH 2 are passed along a chain of electron carriers (electron transport chain) , releasing energy in a series of small steps as the electrons are passed down from high to low energy carriers . Oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor. It is reduced to form metabolic water. Free energy released is used to pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the inter-membrane space against the concentration gradient. As inner-mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to ions , a proton gradient is created across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Protons move back from the inter-membrane space through the ATP synthase complex into the mitochondrial matrix, down the proton gradient . The ATP synthase complex uses the exergonic flow of protons to drive the phosphorylation of ADP to form ATP . Anaerobic Respiration Alcholic Fermentation Property Value Occurence Plants, Yeasts Equation Glucose (6C) 2 Ethanol (2C) + 2 CO 2 A lot of energy remains trapped in in ethanol. Outcome Plants can respire anaerobically only for short periods of time since ethanol is toxic. In yeast, ethanol produced may accumulate in the medium until its concentration rises to a level that kills the yeast. Lactate Fermentation Property Value Occurence Muscles of Animals Equation Pyruvate (3C) + NADH/H + Lactate (2C) + NAD + A lot of energy remains trapped in in lactate too. Outcome Lactate is transported to the liver and converted back to pyruvate. Pyruvate is converted to acetyl CoA, which enter the Krebs Cycle OR Pyruvate is converted to glucose, then to glycogen and stored in the liver or muscles Contributors Ri Zhao Contribute get yourself recognise here \ud83d\udc48","title":"Respiration"},{"location":"biology/respiration/#learning-outcomes","text":"List and give an overview of the four stages of aerobic respiration and indicate where each stage takes place in the eukaryotic cell and mitochondria, and add up the energy captured (as ATP, reduced NAD and FAD) in each stage Explain the production of a small yield of ATP from anaerobic respiration and the formation of ethanol in yeast and lactate in mammals.","title":"Learning Outcomes"},{"location":"biology/respiration/#aerobic-respiration","text":"","title":"Aerobic Respiration"},{"location":"biology/respiration/#glycolysis","text":"","title":"Glycolysis"},{"location":"biology/respiration/#definition","text":"Glycolysis is the sequence of reactions that breaks down glucose to pyruvate with simultaneous trapping of energy released as ATP , accompanied by the formation of NADH/H+ .
